### Product Review App
This is a simple app for reviewing products. Users can review products they've used and see reviews from other users.

## Installation
To install the app, clone the repository and run bundle install to install the required gems:

    ```rb
        $ git clone https://github.com/CKimaru23/product-review.git
        $ cd product-review-app
        $ bundle install
    ```
Then, run the database migrations and seed the database:

    ```rb
        $ bundle exec rake db:migrate db:seed
    ```
This will create the database tables and add some sample data to the database.

## Usage
To run the app, start the rake server:

    ```rb
        $ bundle exec rake server
    ```
Then, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9292/ to see the home page (though not connected to the front-end)
